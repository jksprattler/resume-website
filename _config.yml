  Prior hybrid network engineer transformed cloud engineer with over 10 years' experience in the IT industry. For the past 4+ years, I've held roles primarily working with enterprise-class multi-cloud vendor products, including Amazon (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google (GCP), providing design, development, and delivery of tasks. My specialties include hybrid cloud networking, security, devops, automation, and microservices solutions. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of different companies, including very large, complex enterprises, growing SaaS start-ups, and value-added resellers, making me a well-rounded engineer.
